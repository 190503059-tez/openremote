# OpenRemote v3
#
# By default running this profile installs the stack on https://localhost using a
# self-signed SSL certificate, with username 'admin' and password 'secret'.
#
# Install Docker Community edition (https://docker.com/) on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
#
# Start a transient demo stack with:
#
#   docker-compose -p openremote -f profile/demo.yml up
#
# For full documentation, see deploy.yml
#
# Steps to create a permanent installation:
#
# 1. DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD!
#
# 2. Consider setting a custom DOMAINNAME, LE_EMAIL, and IDENTITY_NETWORK_HOST, see deploy.yml
#
# 3. Understand how bind mounts and volume mappings work, see below and read:
#     https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/
#     https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#choose-the--v-or-mount-flag
#     Survival guide: docker volume ls|rm|prune
#
# 4. Execute once:
#
#   SETUP_WIPE_CLEAN_INSTALL=true \
#   SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret \
#   docker-compose -p openremote -f profile/demo.yml up
#
# This creates the initial database and optionally imports some examples. Inspect the
# running installation and ensure it's working. You are now ready to restart the stack
# without the clean wipe option. Passwords can be changed in the application.
#
# Database schemas will be upgraded to new versions of the services automatically, you do
# not have to wipe all data to install a new version of OpenRemote.
#
# Your extension JAR files should be in the manager's ../deployment/manager/extensions/ directory.

# If you enable volume mappings in services, you need this. Otherwise, remove the volumes

      # Use a named volume. When the volume is empty on startup, the files in the manager
      # image's /deployment directory will be copied into the empty volume, thus
      # giving you a default configuration to modify. Access the volume with:
      #
      # docker run --rm -it -v openremote_deployment-data:/deployment debian:stretch /bin/bash

  # This configuration stores postgresql data in a Docker volume. You manage this volume
  # independently from your stack with with 'docker volume ls', 'docker volume rm', etc.
  # Alternatively, you can store postgresql data in a directory on your host.
